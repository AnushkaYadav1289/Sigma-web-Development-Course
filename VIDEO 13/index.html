            <h1 class="maroon"> What is Mixed Farming </h1>
            <p id="para1"> Mixed farming exists in many forms depending on external and internal factors. External factors are
                weather patterns, market prices, political stability, technological developments, etc. Internal factors
                relate to local soil characteristics, composition of the family and farmers' ingenuity. Farmers can
                decide to opt for mixed enterprises when they want to save resources by interchanging them on the farm -
                because these permit wider crop rotations and thus reduce dependence on chemicals, because they consider
                mixed systems closer to nature, or because they allow diversification for better risk management.</p>
